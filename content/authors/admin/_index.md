I am a grad student in Master of Analytics and broadly interested in AI. My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. I am continuously fascinated by the possibilities we can achieve by the power of data and intelligent machines.

I have worked in various industries, lived in three countries, and speak **5.5** languages. Besides solving problems through data analysis, I like working out and staying fit, extreme sports (did paragliding for a couple of years), reading, watching futuristic, mind-blowing movies and hanging out with friends. 

My mantra: Life is a school, a lifelong one. There is always learning and moving up to the next level of maturity.
